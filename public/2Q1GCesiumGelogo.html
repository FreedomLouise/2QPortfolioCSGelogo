  <h1>The Rise of the King</h1>
  <p>
    Even before stepping foot onto an NBA court, LeBron James had already become a basketball phenomenon. Whether in dunking,
    shooting, passing, none could stop him. He wasn't just bigger or stronger, he was smarter and a leader. He was better. And this
    was proven when he landed on the cover of Sports Illustrated, nicknamed "The Chosen One." And when LeBron declared for the
    2003 NBA draft, his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, won the draft lottery and selected him with first overall pick.
  </p>
  <h1>His First Steps</h1>
  <p>
    The 2003 NBA Draft marked the beginning of LeBron's rise to the top. His rookie debut against the Sacramento Kings showed that 
    he wasn't just a one-hit wonder, scoring 25 points, grabbing 6 rebounds, and dishing 9 assists. The prodigy thrived in the rich soil of the NBA 
    court, and was able to stand his ground against NBA veterans, winning NBA Rookie of the Year.

    that he would be playing with the Miami Heat, teaming up with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. After a rough first season, that
    which refined him into a more complete player, LeBron then went on to win 2 NBA Championships consecutively, 2 NBA Finals 
    MVPs, and two more regular season MVPs. In his time in the Heat, LeBron became a true

  <h1>The Golden Era</h1>
  <h2> "I'm coming home."</h2>
  <p> With LeBron's return to his hometown, he brought with him a promise: delivering his city its long-denied trophy. And 
    that promise he delivered. Facing the Golden State Warriors, LeBron led the team. For the first time in fifty
    years, Cleveland had won its first title.

  <h1>The King</h1>
  <p>
    By winning championships in three different teams, dominating across eras, and standing the test of time, LeBron has cemented
    himself as not just a hero, but a legend — one that continues to stand strong against the newer generation. By surpassing
    Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record, LeBron has transformed himself from the Chosen One to the King.
